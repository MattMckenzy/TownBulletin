React to Twitch and OBS events with dynamically compiled C# modules!

<br />

<br />

## Description

This application will provide a feature-rich, infinitely extendable way to react to any Twitch or OBS event offered by the platforms. 

At its core, it helpls you create, maintain and execute C# modules triggered to run on selected events. The modules are compiled dynamically during runtime and don't even require a web-page refresh to enable!

The web application also features a testing center, which can be used to mock event data and trigger all ready and compiled moodules created for that event. 

There are plenty of other useful features as well, such as a dynamic data service for persistant information storage, ability to load external dll references, rich code editor built-in to the webapp, extendable module templates.

To interact with Twitch and OBS, authentication and authorization credentials must be entered in its settings, which can be updated in the web appllication's configuration page.

## Installation

To install, simply download the TownBulletin-Launcher.exe file available here, and launch it. It will handle downloading and updating the web service, and give you a nice window into it's console log as well as give you a tray icon that can be used to launch the website or shut down the web service.

The web application is coded platform-agnostic, so it will work on linux. The launcher however, is Windows only. For me instructions on getting this to run on Linux, please send me a message and I'll gladly help out!
